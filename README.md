# Hadoop Tutorial

This is a technical tutorial on *Hadoop* that sums up part of my work during CS 8903 at Georgia Tech. This tutorial explains how to install *Hadoop* on a cluster of five nodes, and shows how to write C++ jobs using *Hadoop* *Pipes*. Also included in the tutorial are how to use the ROS API in the MapReduce jobs, as well as a troubleshooting section.
